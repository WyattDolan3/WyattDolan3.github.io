## Datasets
### https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory
Google directory is a powerful tool for creating charts and maps using public data sets that are accessible from google. For example by using datasets from The World Trade Organization, U.S. Census Bureau, World Bank, and countless more organizations and websites I was able to examine fertility rates, sex ratio, population, population denstiy, deaths, and life expectancy throughout the world.
## Science Books
### https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Science:_An_Introduction
This book interests me as it uses a sister project of Wikipedia called Wikibooks. Wikibooks uses authors from all around the world, similarly to GitHub, to create textbooks for anyone to access. This book was co-written by Calvin Andrus, Jon Cook, and Suresh Sood covering an Introduction of Data Science.
